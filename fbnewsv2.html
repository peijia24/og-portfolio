					<p class="text">Let’s take a look at Facebook’s current designs in combating fake news. When I asked users about the current design, these lines stood out:</p>
					<p class="text">"I only clicked on the that info button once, because it didn't really help me understand more about the post." -- "Oh, I didn’t even notice the information button, I thought it was for an ad or something."</p>
					<p class="text">It’s clear that fake news can be hard to distinguish for any user. However, it’s not Facebook’s place to determine what is considered fake news, which leaves a lot of ambiguity and work to the viewer of the article.</p>

					<p class="text">A brief slideshow overlay with critical details is displayed over the article image on auto-scroll. This interaction is triggered by viewport position and hover duration over the post. I chose a moving slideshow so that users are aware of the changing information on their screens, even if they were not initially paying attention to it.</p>
					<p class="text">There are 3 points to story context:
						summary of article, a contextual timeline, and real-time admendments.
					</p>
					<p class="text">These factors have been found to greatly reduce fake news as it breaks down their supposed validity. Having additional information also encourages the user to critically analyze the overall post.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">When I asked users what they thought about the 'more information' tab, I got a couple of common feedback points. First, many readers have a general idea of the publisher, and did not consider this to be top level information.</p>

					<p class="text">Second, 'more from this website' did not provide related posts to the article on-hand, which is what they would like to see as it would help readers determine the context of the post.</p> 

					<p class="text">Lastly, the map in the tab holds little value as there are no map legends asides from indicating where it is shared. However, without understanding how or why the point of sharing may be important (eg. democratic-leaning state), users generally tend to overlook this feature.</p>

					<p class="text">The information button can alert a greater call-to-action by animating after a certain duration of time.</p>
					<p class="text">To start, the information tab can show posts on the same topic but from different publishers and groups can help encourage the viewer to take in alternative perspectives.</p>
					<p class="text">In addition, I wanted to change the order of information displayed in the 'information tab'. As a result of user feedback, I've noted that publisher information is still important, yet it should not be the top information displayed.</p>
					<p class="text">One point of interest I discovered was that Facebook had an 'opinions' feature when you search for key terms, eg. Trump. I believe that this could be a useful feature because it allows users to share and view others' opinions (even if you're not in the same social circle).</p>

				</div>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">One critique of the 'people's opinions' feature is that it may not be helpful because some users may post offensive or biased opinions. In addition, it might just show the perspectives of users that actually post things on their walls with the hashtagged term, which is not reflective of all opinions on Facebook.</p>
					<p class="text">An alternative solution is to create a live, public discourse space where verified pages, figures and groups share opinions about a topic through their updated posts. This can help encourage more awareness of the topic discussed from multiple verified sources.</p>

					<p class="text">I think it might be helpful if Facebook automatically compiles articles that you’ve been reading (or even been exposed to), and sets a space where you can see (compare) what articles other people are reading.</p>
					<p class="text">The purpose of this space to provide insights and opinions from different demographics (outside of your echo chamber). It can also help users realize their viewing patterns and habits. However, one difficulty could be matching appropriate recommendations to past reads, particularly if the content is political.</p>

					<p class="text">Ultimately, I believe a better focus is to gently encourage users to critically analyze by easing the way information is presented on Facebook Newsfeed.</p>
					<p class="text">Not only does this encourage better critical thinking for combatting fake news, these potential solutions will make it harder for fake content to pass as real news.</p>
					<p class="text">Through this exploration, it has taught me to be careful of the subtle nuances in UX design, for example, how do you present information to users without being pushy? (eg. so that they don't leave one platform for another) Or allow the users to feel like they are in control of the information they are exposed to online in an unbiased way?

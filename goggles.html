					One of the key comments that stood out during interviews was the lack of information about the procedure of creating a club as well as collecting student signatures. If more time was given, I would focus on a design of collecting signatures easily, such as sending a support &#x1f44d; indicates that you support the start of the club and have given your signature via student email.

					<p class="text">I decided to go with this interface as it best represented what students were looking for. Quick user interviews pointed out the top navigation bar was most useful for functions such as search and home.</p>
					<p class="text">Following this, I decided to place upcoming, groups and propose features at the bottom nav bar because user research indicated that that although these features are useful, students may not adopt this PWA as their go communication center and calender for clubs. Instead, there was more emphasis on providing updated information and the ease of use to filter through this information.</p>

					<p class="text">School administration and other more traditional office roles may be more familiar with working in a desktop platform. By creating a PWA, this can benefit the full spectrum of people who are comfortable with technology to those who are more old-schooled. For the desktop design, it is a readjustment of the mobile edition, with the search bar remaining static in the left panel and the bottom nav bar moved to a top nav position.</p>

					<p class="text">More further exploration, this design can consider integrating existing tools such as Google Calender or Facebook reviews, which would encourage students to stay involved knowing the club is active.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">If I had more time to work on this project, I would have explored the perspectives of the other parties involved, such as school admins, club organizers and professors. For this redesign, I focused on the students' user experience using the PWA. In addition, I think I could have refined the UI. One potential way to personalize the UI is to match buttons, nav bars and CTA elements with palettes that are correlated to a school's brand colors (eg. blue for UBC).</p>
					<p class="text">However, the biggest challenge I believe that I could improve on is how to design for a PWA and how it would lay out dynamically between both the mobile and desktop version. During the process of creating some of the high-fid mockups, I realize that some of the elements are not optimized for PWAs and that some of wireframe designs are more alike to an app. Thanks for reading! &#9787;</p>

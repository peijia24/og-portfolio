				<div class="summary">
					<p class="text">It’s been a couple of years since the world magnified the role of Facebook and its not so subtle participation in the spread of ‘fake news’. As popularly defined on the internet, fake news is a term used to describe “fake” (or also: misrepresented/inaccurate/false) information, and is often with sensationalized or exaggerated for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait" class="internal_link">clickbait</a> purposes.
					</p>

					<p class="text">But with the upcoming 2020 U.S. Presidential election (and don't forget other political elections eg. Nigeria (2019) (read about it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/africa/fake-news-nigeria-elections-intl/index.html" class="internal_link">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48349671" class="internal_link">here</a>) or India's issue with fake news on WhatsApp (2018/2019) (like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47797151" class="internal_link">this</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-whatsapp-fake-news-1.5139726" class="internal_link">this</a>), it might be time to revisit how Facebook has been handling the fake news incident since 2016.

					<p class="section-title">Introduction.</p>

					<p class="text">Fake news exists for many reasons. One core reason is that <span class="under-line">fake news is written and publish with the intent to damage or influence some type of event, agency, or persons for personal, financial or political gains.</span> Other reasons include that people genuinely believe the news is real, and is thus just sharing. Or there are trolls who do it to cause trouble, although they may not have malicious intentions.</p> 

					<p class="text">Furthermore, it’s often difficult to distinguish fake news from real news in the sense that fake news often appeals to our emotional and communal needs - allowing fake news to quickly gain traction and spread extremely fast throughout social media platforms.</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-meme.png" class="project-img">

					<p class="text">And despite the increased awareness and current solutions (mentioned below), thousands of people are still being informed by Facebook Newsfeed as one of their primary sources of information.</p>

					<p class="section-title">The challenge.</p>
					<p class="text">So the issue of fake news is complicated for a lot of reasons, such as:</p>

					<ul class="points-made">
						<li>Facebook’s current algorithms are designed to show posts that are catered to the user, creating an “echo chamber”; basically you tend to see content related to points of view similar to yourself</li>
						<li>Many fake news posts are made with the intent of economic profit (think ads or how to get max number of clicks) which is a timeless motivation?</li>
						<span class="emphasize-point"><li>Perception of credibility is complex</li></span>
						<li>With more content on the web, it's becoming difficult to trust the media</li>
						<li>Users want to determine the credibility of information they encounter on their own</li>
						<li>Differences in digital literacy between generations</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text">Now a lot of those reasons might sound like common sense, but remember that Mayan calender craze. That didn't make any sense, but it totally exploded across the internet.</p>

					<!-- <img src="assets/fakenews/meme-oreo.png" class="project-img"> -->

					<p class="text wowza">So how exactly does fake news spread?</p> 

					<p class="text">Well, asides from <span class="under-line">appealing to our emotions</span> through strong language, graphic images, and positive or negative hype, etc., fake news spreads because of <span class="under-line">why they were created in the first place - to facilitate social and personal sharing</span> through personal networks. In addition, people tend to use <span class="under-line">shortcuts and heuristics</span> when judging news posts, with a lack of critical thinking and analysis.</p>

					<p class="text">OK so facebook is trying to get the help of fact-checkers, universities, people/audience in general in efforts of finding and elminating fake news and content on their platform. They have acknowledged that this is a huge problem and have real life consequences like ELECTION INFLUENCE, HOW PEOPLE SHARE news and affect people in their circles and just lotsa stuff - like who knows what to believe amiright</p>

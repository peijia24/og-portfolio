				<p class="text">The Weekend Break is an Airbnb redesign project that aims to explore the concept of end-to-end travel. While many people enjoy the excitement of travelling, the planning and transportation process within travelling can be stressful and difficult.</p>
				<p class="text">The Weekend Break aims to reframe two common obstacles in travelling: time & money. This conceptual design aims to optimize the limited time that individuals have within a local context.</p>

				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">In many other trip planning apps, the process is determined by choosing the hotel and the transportation (eg. flights). Sometimes this process is separate or linear, such as Expedia. However, if you decide to change one of your choices, you have to go back to that previous step to restart your booking.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">In order to maintain transparency, I've included visible prices for each mode of transportation. This allows users to see which method of transport best suit their needs and budget, as well as give them a sense of flexibility. Although the departure times are set by the transportation companies, allowing alterations gives users a sense of personalization.</p>
					<p class="text"> I've also included an automated vehicle pick-up time range that works in conjunction with the estimated time of arrival. However, this is adjustable and pick-up times can be delayed by the user. This function was created to streamline the transportation process, and allow users to get to their Airbnb efficiently.</p>
					<p class="text">Both the outbound (leaving home) and inbound (returning home) transportation must be accounted before confirming payment. Finally, it's time to review and book the Weekend Break!</p>

					<p class="text">Pretty straightforward. It's important to let the users know during the process of transportation what to expect, and how the transportation has been pre-arranged for a smooth travel experience.</p>
					<p class="text">In this concept, there would a notification for every point of transportation pass-off (eg. ferry departure, taxi pick-up/drop-off, etc.)</p>

				</div>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">Right now, this design concept would optimally work best for local destinations that are approximately close to the user. This addresses the original goals of this project, which is to optimize the limited time and money constraints for many people who want to travel.</p>
					<p class="text">However, if this were to expand globally, there needs to be further exploration into other features, such working with airlines, allowing last minute changes or giving alternative options for the users, and coordinating with more complex systems of transportations (eg. taxi to bus to flight).</p>

			<div class="content-reflection split">
				<p class="section-title break-top" id="section6">User feedback.</p>
				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">After this process, I decided to test these designs with some potential users.</p>
					<p class="text">There were some enthusiatic "Yes, I would use this!" to "No, I'm not that interested". On the side of those who would use it, they pointed out how I could make the non-linear process of this design clearer. One alternative feature could be to include a timeline feature that the user can refer to as they create their Weekend Break.</p>
					<p class="text">Another point of feedback was that money was still a big constraint for some users. With that, they mentioned that there could be a budget feature that will show them options within that selected budget, and/or show price comparison to other travel sites such as Expedia. However, I would argue that Airbnb is more for the experience and can justify a higher price tag, which may not support this budget feature.</p>
					<p class="text">Some users also were confused by whether if the Weekend Break progress could be saved. They mentioned that they would like all their work to be saved without having to restart the entire planning process - and that they could share this wishlist to confirm with their friends. This would be a further point of exploration.</p>

				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">This project has taught me about the complexity of what may seem to be a simple problem/execution, and has uncovered a lot more questions than problems answered. It's important to understand what users want and what users need, and while users may want a concept like this - do they really need it? How likely is it that people tend to go on a staycation during a weekend? What will be the behind-the-scenes logistics look like for the company?</p>
					<p class="text">Overall, it was fun to practice the visual design of Airbnb and really intriguing to play with the potential UX of something like the Weekend Break. Thanks for reading! &#9787;</p>
